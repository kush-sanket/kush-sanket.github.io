 Dear Sir,
<br />


 I am grateful for applying for the position of Software Graduate Trainee  at Ontum Education. I am a MCA fresher having knowledge in Node.js and JavaScript and possess the attitude to learn new technologies, I have been working on Node.js to develop RESTFUL APIs and to develop app using MVC architecture and building microservices so that reusability of code can be achieved. I have completed my certification in Node.js and I want to explore my potential to work and know more about this technology.

<br />

I had been selected as a finalist in SAP Semicolon Hackathon in 2018. We made a predictive model for sales based on customer behaviour so as to save time for business which will lead to profit for the organization.
<br />

Being a fresher I am flexible to learn new things, and I am sure that I will be able to contribute to the organization.
